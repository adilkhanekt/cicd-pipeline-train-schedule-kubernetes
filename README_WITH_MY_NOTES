Kubernetes cluster config - my_kube_config.yaml

Jenkins deployment to Kubernetes test case:
	- need to use adilkhanekt/train_schedule_node_js image to run the app in Kubernetes
	- Jenkins pipeline was super simplified to just deploy image to the cluster
	- kube service and deployment config file - train-schedule-kube.yaml

Monitoring test case (for simplicity deploy using "kubectl apply"):
	- need to use adilkhanekt/train-schedule-kube-monit image to run the app in Kubernetes
	- kube service and deployment config file - monitoring_train_schedule_instance.yaml
	- to see the metrics that the app publishes need to follow url: http://<public url of the node>:<exposed port number>/metrics
	- need to install prometheus and grafana helm charts with the help of grafana-values.yml, prometheus-values.yml config files
	- need to expose ports for prometheus and grafana to be accessible from outside of cluster by deploying NodePort services using grafana_kube.yaml, prometheus_kube.yaml config files

Self healing test case (for simplicity deploy using "kubectl apply"):
	- need to use adilkhanekt/train-schedule-kube-selfhealing image to run the app in Kuberetes
	- kube service and deployment config file - selfhealing_train_schedule_instance.yaml
	- to test the app failure need to follow url: http://<public url of the node>:<exposed port number>/break

Autoscaling test case (for simplicity deploy using "kubectl apply"):
	- need to use adilkhanekt/train-schedule-kube-autoscaling image to run the app in Kubernetes
	- kube service and deployment config file - autoscaling_train_schedule_instance.yaml
	- need to spin up metrics server in the Kubernetes cluster using components_metrics_server.yaml config file
	- to generate load need to spin up another pod in the cluster:
		kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --image=busybox /bin/sh
	- run the while loop on that load generator pod:
		while true; do wget -q -O- http://<service ip>:8080/generate-cpu-load; done

P.S.: In order to setup this cluster on EC2 instances need to keep in mind about necessary ports that have to open.
List of ports is aggregated in security_group_settings.txt file
